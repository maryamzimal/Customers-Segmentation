# 🛍️ Mall Customer Segmentation – K-Means Clustering

This project applies **unsupervised machine learning** techniques to segment mall customers based on their **Annual Income** and **Spending Score**. The goal is to help businesses better understand customer behavior and design targeted marketing strategies.

---

## 📊 Project Overview

**Data Preparation & Exploration:**  
Loaded and explored the mall customer dataset, checked for missing values, and selected relevant features for clustering.

**Clustering Analysis:**  
Used the **Elbow Method** to determine the optimal number of clusters, applied **K-Means Clustering (k = 5)**, and identified distinct customer segments.

**Visualization:**  
Visualized customer clusters using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**, highlighting cluster centroids for clear interpretation.
